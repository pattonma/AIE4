    "## Part 1: LangGraph - Building Cyclic Applications with LangChain\n",
    "\n",
    "LangGraph is a tool that leverages LangChain Expression Language to build coordinated multi-actor and stateful applications that includes cyclic behaviour.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Cycles?\n",
    "\n",
    "In essence, we can think of a cycle in our graph as a more robust and customizable loop. It allows us to keep our application agent-forward while still giving the powerful functionality of traditional loops.\n",
    "\n",
    "Due to the inclusion of cycles over loops, we can also compose rather complex flows through our graph in a much more readable and natural fashion. Effectively allowing us to recreate application flowcharts in code in an almost 1-to-1 fashion.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why LangGraph?\n",
    "\n",
    "Beyond the agent-forward approach - we can easily compose and combine traditional \"DAG\" (directed acyclic graph) chains with powerful cyclic behaviour due to the tight integration with LCEL. This means it's a natural extension to LangChain's core offerings!"

    "Earlier we used this phrasing:\n",
    "\n",
    "`coordinated multi-actor and stateful applications`\n",
    "\n",
    "So what does that \"stateful\" mean?\n",
    "\n",
    "To put it simply - we want to have some kind of object which we can pass around our application that holds information about what the current situation (state) is. Since our system will be constructed of many parts moving in a coordinated fashion - we want to be able to ensure we have some commonly understood idea of that state.\n",
    "\n",
    "LangGraph leverages a `StatefulGraph` which uses an `AgentState` object to pass information between the various nodes of the graph.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are more options than what we'll see below - but this `AgentState` object is one that is stored in a `TypedDict` with the key `messages` and the value is a `Sequence` of `BaseMessages` that will be appended to whenever the state changes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's think about a simple example to help understand exactly what this means (we'll simplify a great deal to try and clearly communicate what state is doing):\n",
    "\n",
    "1. We initialize our state object:\n",
    "  - `{\"messages\" : []}`\n",
    "2. Our user submits a query to our application.\n",
    "  - New State: `HumanMessage(#1)`\n",
    "  - `{\"messages\" : [HumanMessage(#1)}`\n",
    "3. We pass our state object to an Agent node which is able to read the current state. It will use the last `HumanMessage` as input. It gets some kind of output which it will add to the state.\n",
    "  - New State: `AgentMessage(#1, additional_kwargs {\"function_call\" : \"WebSearchTool\"})`\n",
    "  - `{\"messages\" : [HumanMessage(#1), AgentMessage(#1, ...)]}`\n",
    "4. We pass our state object to a \"conditional node\" (more on this later) which reads the last state to determine if we need to use a tool - which it can determine properly because of our provided object!"

QLoRA backpropagates gradients through\\na frozen, 4-bit quantized pretrained language model into Low Rank\\nAdapters~(LoRA). Our best model family, which we name Guanaco, outperforms all\\nprevious openly released models on the Vicuna benchmark, reaching 99.3% of the\\nperformance level of ChatGPT while only requiring 24 hours of finetuning on a\\nsingle GPU. QLoRA introduces a number of innovations to save memory without\\nsacrificing performance: (a) 4-bit NormalFloat (NF4), a new data type that is\\ninformation theoretically optimal for normally distributed weights (b) double\\nquantization to reduce the average memory footprint by quantizing the\\nquantization constants, and (c) paged optimziers to manage memory spikes. We\\nuse QLoRA to finetune more than 1,000 models, providing a detailed analysis of\\ninstruction following and chatbot performance across 8 instruction datasets,\\nmultiple model types (LLaMA, T5), and model scales that would be infeasible to\\nrun with regular finetuning (e.g. 33B and 65B parameter models). Our results\\nshow that QLoRA finetuning on a small high-quality dataset leads to\\nstate-of-the-art results, even when using smaller models than the previous\\nSoTA. We provide a detailed analysis of chatbot performance based on both human\\nand GPT-4 evaluations showing that GPT-4 evaluations are a cheap and reasonable\\nalternative to human evaluation. Furthermore, we find that current chatbot\\nbenchmarks are not trustworthy to accurately evaluate the performance levels of\\nchatbots. A lemon-picked analysis demonstrates where Guanaco fails compared to\\nChatGPT. We release all of our models and code, including CUDA kernels for\\n4-bit training.\\n\\nPublished: 2024-05-27\\nTitle: Accurate LoRA-Finetuning Quantization of LLMs via Information Retention\\nAuthors: Haotong Qin, Xudong Ma, Xingyu Zheng, Xiaoyang Li, Yang Zhang, Shouda Liu, Jie Luo, Xianglong Liu, Michele Magno\\nSummary: The LoRA-finetuning quantization of LLMs has been extensively studied to\\nobtain accurate yet compact LLMs for deployment on resource-constrained\\nhardware. However, existing methods cause the quantized LLM to severely degrade\\nand even fail to benefit from the finetuning of LoRA. This paper proposes a\\nnovel IR-QLoRA for pushing quantized LLMs with LoRA to be highly accurate\\nthrough information retention. The proposed IR-QLoRA mainly relies on two\\ntechnologies derived from the perspective of unified information: (1)\\nstatistics-based Information Calibration Quantization allows the quantized\\nparameters of LLM to retain original information accurately; (2)\\nfinetuning-based Information Elastic Connection makes LoRA utilizes elastic\\nrepresentation transformation with diverse information. Comprehensive\\nexperiments show that IR-QLoRA can significantly improve accuracy across LLaMA\\nand LLaMA2 families under 2-4 bit-widths, e.g., 4- bit LLaMA-7B achieves 1.4%\\nimprovement on MMLU compared with the state-of-the-art methods. The significant\\nperformance gain requires only a tiny 0.31% additional time consumption,\\nrevealing the satisfactory efficiency of our IR-QLoRA. We highlight that\\nIR-QLoRA enjoys excellent versatility, compatible with various frameworks\\n(e.g., NormalFloat and Integer quantization) and brings general accuracy gains.\\nThe code is available at https://github.com/htqin/ir-qlora.\\n\\nPublished: 2024-06-12\\nTitle: Exploring Fact Memorization and Style Imitation in LLMs Using QLoRA: An Experimental Study and Quality Assessment Methods\\nAuthors: Eugene Vyborov, Oleksiy Osypenko, Serge Sotnyk\\nSummary: There are various methods for adapting LLMs to different domains.

It is a technique used in natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning to improve the performance of language models by combining retrieval-based methods with generative models. Here’s a brief overview of how it works:\\n\\n1. **Retrieval**: In the first step, the system retrieves relevant documents or pieces of information from a large corpus or database. This is typically done using a retrieval model, such as BM25 or a dense retrieval model like DPR (Dense Passage Retrieval).\\n\\n2. **Augmentation**: The retrieved documents are then used to augment the input to the generative model. This means that the generative model has access to additional context or information that can help it produce more accurate and relevant responses.\\n\\n3. **Generation**: Finally, the generative model, such as GPT-3 or BERT, uses the augmented input to generate a response. The additional context provided by the retrieved documents helps the model generate more informed and contextually appropriate responses.\\n\\nRAG is particularly useful in scenarios where the generative model alone might not have enough information to produce a high-quality response, such as in open-domain question answering, customer support, and other applications requiring access to a large knowledge base.'"

For instance, the Guanaco model family, fine-tuned using QLoRA, achieves 99.3% of ChatGPT's performance on the Vicuna benchmark.\\n- **Innovations**:\\n  - **4-bit NormalFloat (NF4)**: An optimal data type for normally distributed weights.\\n  - **Double Quantization**: Reduces memory footprint by quantizing the quantization constants.\\n  - **Paged Optimizers**: Manages memory spikes effectively.\\n- **Evaluation**: QLoRA fine-tuning on high-quality datasets leads to state-of-the-art results, even with smaller models. Evaluations using both human and GPT-4 metrics show that QLoRA can produce high-quality outputs.\\n\\n#### Full Fine-Tuning\\n- **Resource Intensive**: Requires significantly more memory and computational resources, making it less feasible for very large models on limited hardware.\\n- **Performance**: Generally considered the gold standard for achieving the highest possible performance, as it allows for the most extensive adjustments to the model's parameters.\\n- **Flexibility**: Full fine-tuning can adapt the entire model to the new task, potentially leading to better performance on specific tasks compared to more memory-efficient methods.\\n\\n#### Comparative Findings\\n- **Memory Efficiency**: QLoRA is far more memory-efficient, making it possible to fine-tune very large models on hardware that would be insufficient for full fine-tuning.\\n- **Performance**: QLoRA achieves near state-of-the-art performance, closely matching the results of full fine-tuning in many cases. However, for the absolute highest performance, full fine-tuning may still have a slight edge.\\n- **Practicality**: For many applications, especially where resources are limited, QLoRA offers a highly practical alternative to full fine-tuning without a significant drop in quality.\\n\\nIn summary, QLoRA provides a highly efficient and effective method for fine-tuning large language models, achieving performance levels close to full fine-tuning while drastically reducing memory requirements. This makes it a valuable approach for scenarios where computational resources are a limiting factor.\",\n",

Here’s a detailed explanation of how it works:\\n\\n1. **Quantization**:\\n   - **Reduced Precision**: QLoRA reduces the precision of the model parameters from 32-bit floating-point (FP32) to lower precision formats such as 8-bit integers (INT8). This significantly reduces the memory footprint of the model.\\n   - **Efficient Storage**: By storing weights and activations in lower precision, the amount of memory required to store these values is reduced. This allows for larger models to be loaded into memory without exceeding hardware limitations.\\n\\n2. **Low-Rank Adaptation**:\\n   - **Parameter Efficiency**: Low-rank adaptation involves decomposing the weight matrices into products of smaller matrices. This reduces the number of parameters that need to be stored and updated during training.\\n   - **Memory Savings**: By using low-rank approximations, the memory required for storing and updating the model parameters is reduced. This is because the low-rank matrices have fewer parameters compared to the original full-rank matrices.\\n\\n3. **Combination of Techniques**:\\n   - **Synergistic Effect**: The combination of quantization and low-rank adaptation provides a synergistic effect, where the memory savings from each technique are compounded. This allows QLoRA to achieve significant memory efficiency without compromising the model’s performance.\\n\\n4. **Training Efficiency**:\\n   - **Reduced Computation**: With fewer parameters to update and lower precision arithmetic, the computational requirements for training are also reduced. This leads to faster training times and lower energy consumption.\\n\\nOverall, QLoRA leverages these techniques to enable the training and deployment of large-scale models on hardware with limited memory resources, making it a powerful approach for efficient deep learning.',\n",

Here are the key components of the QLoRA system based on recent research:\\n\\n1. **Quantized Low-Rank Adapters (QLoRA)**:\\n   - **Low-Rank Adapters (LoRA)**: These are used to fine-tune LLMs by adding low-rank matrices to the model\\'s layers, which helps in reducing the number of trainable parameters.\\n   - **Quantization**: This involves reducing the precision of the model parameters to lower bit-widths, which helps in saving memory and computational resources.\\n\\n2. **Fine-Tuning Techniques**:\\n   - **Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning**: QLoRA focuses on fine-tuning only a subset of the model parameters, which makes the process more efficient and less resource-intensive.\\n   - **Memory Optimization**: By using quantized parameters, the system can handle larger models or datasets within the same hardware constraints.\\n\\n3. **Integration with Large Language Models (LLMs)**:\\n   - QLoRA is used to fine-tune state-of-the-art LLMs like Llama 2, enhancing their performance for specific tasks such as speaker attribution in political debates or retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems.\\n\\n4. **User Feedback Incorporation**:\\n   - The system can incorporate user feedback directly into the training process, ensuring continuous adaptation and improvement of the model based on user expectations.\\n\\n5. **Quantized Influence Measure (QIM)**:\\n   - This is an innovative mechanism introduced to enhance the precision of result selection in AI systems, acting as an \"AI Judge\" to refine the system\\'s accuracy.\\n\\n6. **Economic and Legal Compliance**:\\n   - The QLoRA system is designed to be legally compliant and economically sustainable, addressing issues like copyright in AI training and providing a framework for monetization that benefits content creators, AI developers, and end-users.\\n\\n7. **Applications**:\\n   - The system has been applied in various domains, including automating speaker attribution in political texts, enhancing retrieval-augmented generation systems, and creating legally compliant marketplaces for generative AI.\\n\\nThese components collectively make QLoRA a powerful and efficient approach for fine-tuning large language models, optimizing their performance while minimizing resource usage.',\n",

      "Fine-tuning is a process in machine learning where a pre-trained model is further trained on a new dataset to adapt it to a specific task. This approach leverages the knowledge the model has already acquired during its initial training on a large, general dataset, and refines it to perform well on a more specialized task. Fine-tuning is particularly useful in natural language processing (NLP) and computer vision, where large pre-trained models like BERT, GPT, and ResNet can be adapted to specific applications with relatively small amounts of additional data.\n",
