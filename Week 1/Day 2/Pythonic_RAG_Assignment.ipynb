    "\n",
    "We know they have roles - as is indicated in the following API [documentation](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/chat/create#chat/create-messages)\n",
    "\n",
    "There are three roles, and they function as follows (taken directly from [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/gpt/chat-completions-api)):\n",
    "\n",
    "- `{\"role\" : \"system\"}` : The system message helps set the behavior of the assistant. For example, you can modify the personality of the assistant or provide specific instructions about how it should behave throughout the conversation. However note that the system message is optional and the model’s behavior without a system message is likely to be similar to using a generic message such as \"You are a helpful assistant.\"\n",
    "- `{\"role\" : \"user\"}` : The user messages provide requests or comments for the assistant to respond to.\n",
    "- `{\"role\" : \"assistant\"}` : Assistant messages store previous assistant responses, but can also be written by you to give examples of desired behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main idea is this:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. You start with a system message that outlines how the LLM should respond, what kind of behaviours you can expect from it, and more\n",
    "2. Then, you can provide a few examples in the form of \"assistant\"/\"user\" pairs\n",
    "3. Then, you prompt the model with the true \"user\" message.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, we'll be forgoing the 2nd step for simplicities sake."

This works sort of like seeding an RNG, giving the model a consistent 'starting point'. Another way you can (sort of) achieve consistent results is by lowering the temperature of the model. Setting the temperature to 0 won't *necessarily* give you consistent results like setting a seed would, but it will make the model act more deterministically, which would help."

      "The best way to write a loop in Python often depends on the specific use case you have in mind. However, here are some general guidelines for writing effective loops:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Use `for` loops for iterating over collections**: If you're working with a sequence (like a list, tuple, or string), a `for` loop is typically cleaner and more Pythonic.\n",
      "\n",
      "   ```python\n",
      "   my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n",
      "   for item in my_list:\n",
      "       print(item)\n",
      "   ```\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Use `while` loops for conditions**: If you need the loop to continue until a specific condition is met, a `while` loop is appropriate.\n",
      "\n",
      "   ```python\n",
      "   count = 0\n",
      "   while count < 5:\n",
      "       print(count)\n",
      "       count += 1\n",
      "   ```\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Avoid modifying the collection while looping**: Changing the size of a collection while iterating over it can lead to unexpected behavior. If you need to remove items, consider creating a copy of the collection or using a list comprehension.\n",
      "\n",
      "   ```python\n",
      "   my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n",
      "   my_list = [item for item in my_list if item != 3]  # Remove 3 safely\n",
      "   ```\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Utilize `enumerate`** when you need the index and value: This helps avoid manual indexing and makes your code clearer.\n",
      "\n",
      "   ```python\n",
      "   my_list = ['a', 'b', 'c']\n",
      "   for index, value in enumerate(my_list):\n",
      "       print(index, value)\n",
      "   ```\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Use list comprehensions for simple transformations**: If you're transforming or filtering a list, a list comprehension can make your code more concise and readable.\n",
      "\n",
      "   ```python\n",
      "   squares = [x**2 for x in range(10)]\n",
      "   ```\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **Keep the loop body concise**: Try to keep the contents of your loops as simple as possible to improve readability and maintainability.\n",
      "\n",
      "Remember to always test your loops and consider edge cases. If you have a specific scenario, feel free to share, and I can provide more tailored advice!\n"
